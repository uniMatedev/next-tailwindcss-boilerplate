  <h1>Next Tailwind CSS Boilerplate</h1>
  <p>This boilerplate provides a basic setup for a Next.js project that uses Tailwind CSS for styling. It includes the latest version of Tailwind CSS (v3.2) at the time of writing, and follows the steps outlined in the official <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs">Tailwind CSS documentation</a>.</p>
  <h2>Getting started</h2>
  <p>To use this boilerplate, you can either clone the repository to your local machine or create a new Next.js project using <code>npx create-next-app</code> and the <code>--example</code> flag:</p>
  <pre><code>npx create-next-app my-app --example https://github.com/uniMatedev/next-tailwindcss-boilerplate.git</code></pre>
  <p>Once you have the boilerplate set up, you can start customizing it to meet your project's requirements. The boilerplate includes a basic directory structure and some example components to help you get started.</p>
  <h2>Deploying to the cloud</h2>
  <p>When you're ready to deploy your project to the cloud, you can use Vercel to quickly and easily deploy your Next.js application. To get started, sign up for a free account at <a href="https://vercel.com">vercel.com</a>, connect your GitHub or GitLab account, and create a new project.
