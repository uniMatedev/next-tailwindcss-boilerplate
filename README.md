Next Tailwind Boilerplate
This boilerplate is designed to get you up and running quickly with a new project that combines the power of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It follows the steps outlined in the official Tailwind CSS documentation, and includes the latest version of Tailwind CSS (v3.2) at the time of writing.

Getting started
To use this boilerplate, you can either clone the repository to your local machine or create a new Next.js project using npx create-next-app and the --example flag:

bash
Copy code
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/uniMatedev/next-tailwindcss-boilerplate.git
Once you have the boilerplate set up, you can start customizing it to meet your project's requirements. The boilerplate includes a basic directory structure and some example components to help you get started.

Deploying to the cloud
When you're ready to deploy your project to the cloud, you can use Vercel to quickly and easily deploy your Next.js application. To get started, sign up for a free account at vercel.com, connect your GitHub or GitLab account, and create a new project. You can then link your repository to the Vercel project and deploy your application with just a few clicks.
